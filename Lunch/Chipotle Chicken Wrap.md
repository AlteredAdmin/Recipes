# Chipotle Chicken Wrap

## Ingredients:
- Diced chicken breasts or tenders
- 1 can of chipotles in adobo (use less peppers if you dont want it spicy)
- mayonnaise
- Ground cumin
- tortillas
- Cheese, Colby is good.
- sour cream
- Dill Ranch
- Shredded Lettuce
- Diced tomatoes
- Pickled Red Onions, or just regular red onions.

## Directions:
1. **Prepare Chicken**: Finely chop the chicken into cubes and place them in a mixing bowl.
2. **Marinate**: Add salt, minced adobo chilies, mayonnaise, and cumin to the chicken. Stir until each piece is evenly coated. For enhanced flavor, allow the chicken to marinate for up to overnight, although this step is optional.
3. **Cook**: Heat a pan or griddle over high heat. There's no need for additional oil, as the mayonnaise in the marinade contains sufficient fat. 
4. **Sear the Chicken**: Place the chicken cubes in the pan. Let them sear undisturbed for a few minutes to develop a golden brown crust on one side, then flip and continue cooking until all sides are well-colored and the chicken is fully cooked.
5. **Rest the Chicken**: Once done, remove the chicken from the heat and let it rest briefly.
6. **Assemble Tacos**: Spread dill ranch and sour cream on each tortilla.
7. **Add Toppings**: Sprinkle cheese over the sauces, then add the cooked chicken. Finish with pickled onions, shredded lettuce, and diced tomatoes for a burst of freshness and flavor.
8. Save left over chicken for quick lunch trough out the week.
