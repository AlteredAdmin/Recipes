A classic steak recipe that never fails to impress is a simple yet flavorful pan-seared steak with a garlic herb butter. Here's a basic recipe to get you started:

Ingredients:
- 2 steaks (ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon, about 1 inch thick)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or parsley), chopped

Instructions:
1. Take the steaks out of the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This allows them to cook more evenly.
2. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.
3. Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add the oil and heat until shimmering but not smoking.
4. Carefully place the steaks in the hot skillet. Cook without moving them for about 3-4 minutes for medium-rare (adjust time according to your preferred doneness), then flip them using tongs.
5. Add the butter to the skillet along with the minced garlic and herbs. Tilt the skillet slightly and use a spoon to baste the steaks with the melted butter. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, continuing to baste the steaks with the butter, until they reach your desired level of doneness.
6. Transfer the steaks to a plate and let them rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute and ensures a juicy steak.
7. Serve the steaks whole or sliced, drizzling any remaining garlic herb butter from the skillet over the top.

You can adjust the seasoning and herbs according to your taste preferences, and don't hesitate to experiment with different cuts of steak or additional ingredients like mushrooms or onions for variation. Enjoy your delicious steak!
