# Breakfast Egg Bites

This recipe yields approximately 12 egg bites, depending on the size of the eggs used. You can easily adjust the quantities to double or triple the batch as desired.

## Ingredients:
- 10 eggs
- 1 cup of your preferred cheese
- 1/2 cup full-fat cottage cheese
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Bacon, as much as you like or Cubed Ham
- Non-stick cooking spray (canola oil recommended)

## Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C). Place a baking dish filled with water on the bottom rack to help the egg bites stay moist during baking.
2. Cook the bacon slices to your liking before incorporating them into the egg bites.
3. Combine the eggs, cheese, cottage cheese, salt, and pepper in a blender. Blend until the mixture is smooth.
4. Generously spray a muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray. Pour the egg mixture into each muffin cup, filling them nearly to the top.
5. Evenly distribute the chopped bacon among the muffin cups.
6. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the centers of the egg bites are just set.
7. Store the egg bites in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze them for longer storage. To reheat, microwave the egg bites covered with a damp paper towel for one minute.
