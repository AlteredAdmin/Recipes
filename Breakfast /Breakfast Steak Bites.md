# Breakfast Steak Bites

**Note:** Recommend to serve with a side of scrambled eggs.

## Ingredients:
- 2 steaks
- Minced garlic
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter
- Salt
- Pepper
- Rosemary
- coconut aminos
- avocado oil

## Directions:
1. Cut your steaks into cubes.
2. Salt, pepper, minced garlic, and sprinkle rosemary on the cubes. Add some coconut aminos to the bowl and mix well. Cook it or let it sit overnight. If you let it sit overnight, make sure to take it out and let it come up to temperature before cooking.
3. On a high heat cast iron skillet add avocado oil, add steak. Halfway through add butter & a little coconut aminos; you're going to cook your cubes on each side for 30 seconds to a minute on each side. Cook to your desired doneness.
