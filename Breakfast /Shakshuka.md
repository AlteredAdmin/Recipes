## Ingredients:
- 28 oz Can crushed tomatoes
- 3 tablespoons (42g) butter 
- 1 bell pepper (Red)
- 1 onion 
- 4 cloves garlic 
- 6 eggs 
- 1 teaspoon(2g) ground cumin 
- 1 teaspoon(2g) sweet paprika 
- 1/2 teaspoon (1g) cayenne 
- Salt pepper to taste

## Improved Directions:
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large ovenproof skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
3. Add diced peppers, onions, and minced garlic to the skillet. Sauté until the vegetables are soft and the onions are translucent, about 5-7 minutes.
4. Once the vegetables are cooked, reduce the heat to low.
5. Stir in your choice of seasonings (e.g., salt, pepper, paprika) and continue to sauté for another 2 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
6. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and stir to combine. Allow the mixture to heat through, about 3-4 minutes.
7. When the tomato mixture is simmering, make small wells in the sauce and carefully crack an egg into each indentation.
8. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Bake until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny, about 7-10 minutes.
9. Serve hot over slices of toasted bread. Sprinkle grated cheese (such as cheddar or Parmesan) on top before serving. Enjoy!
